Code is really not clean nor simple. lot of duplicates code and a cascade of if condition to make work its logic.

7. Do you think the rules are clear enough so that you could rework the entire solution
from scratch?
There is a lack of clarity in somes of the rules, re-creating the solution from scratch could lead to differents results than the outpout

Even if it take more time it will be more adequate for the users of the app.
